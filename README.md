### Experience 

ðŸ”¥ Product-focused Data Scientist ðŸ”¥

- B2B SaaS Enterprise (current)
- Ad Tech
- Gaming
- Non-Profit

I worked at small to very large-scale companies, so I enjoy getting my hands dirty and solving complex data-driven problems. My passion lies in enabling product growth using data and statistical theories.

- End-to-End designing of company-wide product success measurement through constant hypothesis validation on user behaviors
- Production-level software & data tooling development. Projects involve data pipelining, object-oriented design/refactoring, integration-testing, and operational maintenance.
- Experience with petabyte-scale data handling techniques such as Spark
- Familiarity with Ad-tech domains; real-time bidding, incrementality testing, brand-lift, AB experimenting, etc

#### Skills

- Programming - Python, R, SQL (Snowflake, MySQL, Postgre), Shell, HTML, CSS
- Cloud Service - AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Spark,
- Visualization - Tableau, Dash(python), Power BI, Excel
- Web - Heap, Google Analytics
